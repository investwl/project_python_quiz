Hello! Welcome to this Python Quiz!

In this Python Quiz, you would first require an account, so the first menu would be create account or login account.

As a new player, you would choose 'create account' by typing in 'A' because its the letter that assigns 'create account'.
If you already have an account, then just log into your account using the username and password.

After logging in to your account, there would be a main menu with various options.

The most important ones would be 'Play Quiz' and 'Add Question'.

Play Quiz would be an option to play the quiz entirely, all questions from the devs and the players that has been collected.

Add Question would be an option where users can create a multiple choice question with a minimum choice of 2 (e.g True or False).

The rest would be Logout, About Us, Quiz Instruction, and Exit. 
Logout means changing account, Exit means you stopped playing the game.

That is all about the instructions, best of luck !
